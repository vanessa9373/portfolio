## Summary (The "Elevator Pitch")

Migrated a client's legacy on-premises infrastructure to AWS, re-architecting a monolithic application into containerized microservices on ECS Fargate with Aurora PostgreSQL. Reduced infrastructure costs by 35% while achieving 99.95% uptime — all provisioned through Terraform.

## The Problem

The client was running aging on-premises servers with **94% uptime**, high maintenance costs (~$45,000/month), 2-week provisioning cycles for new environments, and **zero disaster recovery**. Every hardware failure meant scrambling to restore from backups manually. Scaling required purchasing and racking new servers — a process that took weeks.

## The Solution

Designed a cloud-native architecture on AWS using **ECS Fargate** for serverless container orchestration (no servers to manage), **Aurora PostgreSQL** for a managed database with automatic Multi-AZ failover, and **ALB** for traffic management — all provisioned via **Terraform** so the entire environment can be recreated in 30 minutes.

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose | Why I Chose It |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| AWS VPC | Network isolation with public/private subnets | Industry standard for secure cloud networking |
| ECS Fargate | Serverless container orchestration | No EC2 to manage; pay only for what you use |
| Aurora PostgreSQL | Managed database with Multi-AZ failover | 5x faster than standard PostgreSQL, automatic backups |
| Application Load Balancer | HTTPS termination and traffic routing | Native ECS integration, path-based routing |
| Terraform | Infrastructure as Code | Declarative, reproducible, version-controlled |
| Docker | Application containerization | Consistent environments from dev to production |
| CloudWatch | Logging, metrics, and alarms | Built-in AWS integration |
| ECR | Container image registry | Private, encrypted, integrates with ECS |

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Clone and Configure
**What this does:** Sets up the project and configures AWS-specific values.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanessa9373/portfolio.git
cd portfolio/labs/01-cloud-migration
cp terraform/terraform.tfvars.example terraform/terraform.tfvars
```

### Step 2: Initialize and Plan
**What this does:** Downloads AWS provider plugins. `plan` shows what will be created before making changes.
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan
```

### Step 3: Deploy Network Layer
**What this does:** Creates VPC, 4 subnets (2 public, 2 private across 2 AZs), internet gateway, NAT gateways, route tables, and security groups.
```bash
terraform apply tfplan
```

### Step 4: Build and Push Docker Image
**What this does:** Builds the app container using a multi-stage Dockerfile, then pushes to ECR.
```bash
cd ../docker
docker build -t migration-app:latest .
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
docker tag migration-app:latest <ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/migration-app:latest
docker push <ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/migration-app:latest
```

### Step 5: Deploy ECS Services
**What this does:** Creates ECS cluster, task definitions, and services. ECS places tasks across AZs automatically.
```bash
cd ../terraform
terraform apply -target=aws_ecs_service.app
```

### Step 6: Verify Deployment
**What this does:** Tests that the application is responding through the load balancer.
```bash
terraform output alb_dns_name
curl -I http://$(terraform output -raw alb_dns_name)
```

### Step 7: Configure DNS and Monitoring
**What this does:** Points your domain to the ALB. CloudWatch dashboards/alarms are provisioned automatically by Terraform.

## Key Files Explained

| File | What It Does | Key Concepts |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `terraform/main.tf` | Defines all AWS resources — VPC, subnets, ECS, Aurora, ALB, security groups, CloudWatch | IaC, resource dependencies, Multi-AZ |
| `terraform/variables.tf` | Parameterizes infrastructure — change region or size without editing main.tf | Variable types, defaults, validation |
| `docker/Dockerfile` | Multi-stage build: first stage compiles, second stage copies binary into slim image | Build optimization, smaller attack surface |
| `docs/migration-plan.md` | 4-phase plan: Assess, Plan, Migrate, Optimize | Migration methodology |
| `docs/architecture.md` | Documents why ECS over EKS, why Aurora over standard RDS | Architecture Decision Records |

## Results & Metrics

| Metric | Before (On-Prem) | After (AWS) | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Monthly Infra Cost | $45,000 | $29,250 | **35% reduction** |
| Uptime | 94% | 99.95% | **+5.95%** |
| Provisioning Time | 2 weeks | 30 minutes | **98% faster** |
| Disaster Recovery | None | Multi-AZ automated | **Full DR** |
| Deployment Frequency | Monthly | Daily | **30x faster** |

## How I'd Explain This in an Interview

> "A client was running a monolithic app on aging on-prem servers with 94% uptime and no disaster recovery. I led the migration to AWS — re-architected the app into containerized microservices on ECS Fargate, replaced Oracle with Aurora PostgreSQL for automatic failover, and wrote the entire infrastructure in Terraform. The result was 35% cost reduction, 99.95% uptime, and 30x faster deployments. The key decision was choosing ECS Fargate over EKS — the client didn't need Kubernetes complexity, and Fargate eliminated all server management."

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Cloud Migration Strategy** — 4-phase approach: Assess, Plan, Migrate, Optimize
- **Infrastructure as Code** — Entire environment defined in Terraform
- **Containerization** — Multi-stage Docker builds for production
- **High Availability** — Multi-AZ deployment with ALB and Aurora failover
- **Cost Optimization** — Right-sizing with Fargate (pay per task)
- **Architecture Decision Records** — Documented ECS vs EKS, Aurora vs RDS trade-offs
- **Network Security** — Private subnets for compute/data, public only for ALB

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with the database** — highest-risk component, needs the most testing
2. **Use AWS DMS** — handles ongoing replication during cutover, avoids downtime
3. **Right-size from day one** — Fargate makes it easy to adjust without over-provisioning
4. **Invest in IaC early** — Terraform pays dividends when replicating environments
5. **Plan DNS cutover carefully** — lower TTLs 48 hours before migration
