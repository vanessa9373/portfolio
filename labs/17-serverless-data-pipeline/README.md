## Summary (The "Elevator Pitch")

Architected a serverless event-driven pipeline using Lambda, SQS, and DynamoDB that processes 1M+ events per day for a SaaS analytics platform. Replaced costly always-on EC2 infrastructure with pay-per-invocation serverless — cutting costs by 70% while improving latency to under 100ms.

## The Problem

The client's analytics pipeline ran on EC2 instances that were provisioned for peak load but sat idle 80% of the time. Monthly EC2 costs were high, scaling was manual, and the system couldn't handle traffic spikes without dropping events. When a server crashed, events were lost because there was no message queue buffering.

## The Solution

Replaced the EC2 fleet with a **serverless architecture**: **API Gateway** receives events, **Lambda** (Ingestion) validates and publishes to **SQS** (message queue for buffering), **Lambda** (Processor) reads from SQS and writes to **DynamoDB** (real-time queries) and **S3** (long-term archive). Dead Letter Queue catches failed events. Costs dropped 70% because you only pay when events are actually being processed.

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose | Why I Chose It |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| API Gateway | HTTPS endpoint for event ingestion | Managed, auto-scaling, request validation |
| Lambda (Ingestion) | Event validation and SQS publishing | Serverless, 15-minute max execution, pay-per-invocation |
| SQS | Message buffering between Lambda functions | Decouples ingestion from processing, handles spikes |
| Lambda (Processor) | Batch processing from SQS | Processes 10 messages at a time for efficiency |
| DynamoDB | Real-time event storage and queries | Single-digit millisecond reads, auto-scaling |
| S3 | Long-term event archival | Cheap storage with lifecycle policies |
| Dead Letter Queue | Failed event capture | Prevents data loss, enables retry |
| CloudWatch Events | Scheduled aggregation jobs | Trigger daily/hourly summary reports |

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Infrastructure
**What this does:** Creates API Gateway, Lambda functions, SQS queues, DynamoDB table, S3 bucket, DLQ, IAM roles, and CloudWatch alarms using Terraform.
```bash
cd terraform && terraform init && terraform apply
```

### Step 2: Package and Deploy Ingestion Lambda
**What this does:** Packages the ingestion handler (event validation, schema checking, SQS publishing) and deploys it to Lambda.
```bash
cd src/ingestion
zip -r function.zip .
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name ingestion --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```

### Step 3: Package and Deploy Processor Lambda
**What this does:** Packages the processor handler (SQS batch reading, DynamoDB writes, S3 archival) and deploys it.
```bash
cd ../processor
zip -r function.zip .
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name processor --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```

### Step 4: Test the Pipeline
**What this does:** Sends a test event through the full pipeline and verifies it appears in DynamoDB and S3.
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event_type": "page_view", "user_id": "u123", "page": "/home"}'
```

### Step 5: Verify Processing
**What this does:** Confirms the event was processed by checking DynamoDB and S3.
```bash
# Check DynamoDB
aws dynamodb scan --table-name analytics-events --limit 5

# Check S3 archive
aws s3 ls s3://analytics-archive/events/
```

### Step 6: Monitor Pipeline Health
**What this does:** CloudWatch dashboards show invocation counts, error rates, SQS queue depth, and DLQ messages.

|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Monthly Cost | $15,000 | $4,500 | **70% savings** |
| Events Processed | 500K/day (max) | **1M+/day** (auto-scales) | **2x capacity** |
| Latency | 200-500ms | **< 100ms** | **2-5x faster** |
| Availability | 99.5% (manual scaling) | **99.99%** (managed) | **Near-zero downtime** |
| Events Lost on Failure | Common (no queue) | **Zero** (SQS + DLQ) | **No data loss** |

## How I'd Explain This in an Interview

> "The client's analytics pipeline ran on EC2 instances provisioned for peak load but idle 80% of the time. I replaced it with a serverless architecture: API Gateway receives events, a Lambda function validates and publishes to SQS (which buffers traffic spikes), another Lambda processes batches of 10 messages and writes to DynamoDB for real-time queries and S3 for long-term archive. Failed events go to a Dead Letter Queue instead of being lost. Costs dropped 70% because we only pay when events are processed, and the system auto-scales to handle 1M+ events/day without any manual intervention."

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Serverless Architecture** — No servers to manage, pay-per-invocation
- **Event-Driven Design** — API Gateway → Lambda → SQS → Lambda
- **Message Queue Decoupling** — SQS buffers between ingestion and processing
- **Dead Letter Queue** — Failed events captured, not lost
- **Batch Processing** — Lambda processes 10 SQS messages at a time
- **Cost Optimization** — 70% savings vs always-on EC2
- **Idempotent Processing** — DynamoDB conditional writes prevent duplicates

## Lessons Learned

1. **SQS is the key to resilience** — without the queue, Lambda failures mean lost events
2. **Batch processing is essential** — processing one event at a time wastes Lambda cold starts
3. **DLQ saves you in production** — without it, failed events vanish silently
4. **DynamoDB on-demand pricing** — use on-demand mode for unpredictable traffic
5. **Lambda cold starts matter** — use provisioned concurrency for latency-sensitive paths
