## Summary (The "Elevator Pitch")

Multi-layer autoscaling eliminates both over-provisioning waste and under-provisioning outages by scaling at the pod, container, and node levels simultaneously. This lab implements HPA v2 with CPU, memory, and custom Prometheus metrics for pod-level scaling, VPA for container right-sizing recommendations, Karpenter for just-in-time node provisioning, and KEDA for event-driven scaling from SQS queue depth -- creating a fully responsive infrastructure that matches capacity to demand in real time.

## The Problem

The e-commerce platform runs with a fixed replica count of 10 pods across all hours. During off-peak hours (midnight to 6 AM), 8 of those pods sit idle, wasting approximately $2,400/month in compute costs. During flash sales and peak traffic (Black Friday, product launches), the 10 pods are overwhelmed -- CPU saturates, response times spike from 200ms to 8 seconds, and users receive 503 errors. Scaling is handled through support tickets: a developer opens a ticket, an ops engineer manually increases the replica count, waits for pods to schedule, and then forgets to scale back down. The background job queue has the same problem -- SQS queue depth grows to 50,000+ messages during peak, but the worker Deployment has a fixed 5 replicas regardless of queue size. The team needs automatic, responsive scaling at every layer.

## The Solution

We implement four complementary autoscaling mechanisms. HPA v2 scales the web Deployment based on CPU utilization (primary metric), memory utilization (secondary), and requests-per-second from Prometheus (custom metric via Prometheus Adapter). VPA runs in recommendation mode, analyzing actual resource usage to suggest right-sized requests and limits without disrupting running pods. Karpenter replaces Cluster Autoscaler for node-level scaling, provisioning right-sized EC2 instances in under 60 seconds when pods are unschedulable. KEDA watches the SQS queue depth and scales the worker Deployment from 0 to 50 replicas proportional to the number of pending messages. Together, these four layers ensure the platform scales from 2 pods on 2 nodes at 3 AM to 50 pods on 15 nodes during a flash sale, all automatically.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Application with HPA v2 (CPU Target)

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/deployment-scalable.yaml
kubectl apply -f manifests/hpa-v2.yaml

# Verify HPA is configured and reading metrics
kubectl get hpa myapp-hpa
kubectl describe hpa myapp-hpa
```

**What this does:** Deploys a web application with resource requests (required for HPA to calculate utilization percentage) and an HPA v2 object targeting 70% CPU utilization. The HPA controller checks metrics every 15 seconds and adjusts replica count between 2 (minimum) and 50 (maximum). The stabilization window prevents flapping by waiting 300 seconds before scaling down.

### Step 2: Add Memory and Custom Metric Targets to HPA

```bash
# View the multi-metric HPA configuration
kubectl get hpa myapp-hpa -o yaml

# The HPA targets three metrics:
# 1. CPU utilization: 70%
# 2. Memory utilization: 80%
# 3. Custom metric: requests_per_second (from Prometheus)
```

**What this does:** Configures the HPA with multiple scaling metrics. HPA v2 evaluates all metrics and uses the one that recommends the highest replica count, ensuring the application scales up on whichever bottleneck appears first -- whether that is CPU saturation, memory pressure, or increasing request rate.

### Step 3: Install Prometheus Adapter for Custom Metrics

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/prometheus-adapter-config.yaml

# Verify custom metrics are available
kubectl get --raw "/apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1" | jq .
kubectl get --raw "/apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/default/pods/*/http_requests_per_second" | jq .
```

**What this does:** Deploys and configures the Prometheus Adapter, which reads metrics from Prometheus and serves them through the Kubernetes custom metrics API. This bridge allows HPA to scale on any metric that Prometheus collects -- request rate, error rate, queue depth, or any application-specific metric exposed via /metrics endpoint.

### Step 4: Deploy VPA in Recommendation Mode

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/vpa.yaml

# Wait for VPA to collect enough data (at least 5 minutes of metrics)
sleep 300

# Check VPA recommendations
kubectl describe vpa myapp-vpa
```

**What this does:** Installs a VerticalPodAutoscaler in "Off" mode (recommendation only), which monitors actual CPU and memory consumption of the application over time and generates recommended resource requests. Unlike "Auto" mode, this does not restart pods -- it provides data-driven suggestions for engineers to update their manifests, avoiding the risk of VPA evicting pods to right-size them.

### Step 5: Configure Karpenter NodePool

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/karpenter-nodepool.yaml

# View the NodePool configuration
kubectl get nodepool default -o yaml
kubectl get ec2nodeclass default -o yaml
```

**What this does:** Creates a Karpenter NodePool that defines which EC2 instance types, availability zones, and capacity types (spot vs on-demand) are eligible for provisioning. When pods are unschedulable due to insufficient cluster capacity, Karpenter selects the optimal instance type based on the pending pods' resource requirements, provisions the node in under 60 seconds, and enables consolidation to bin-pack underutilized nodes.

### Step 6: Install KEDA and Create ScaledObject

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/keda-scaledobject.yaml

# Verify KEDA is watching the SQS queue
kubectl get scaledobject worker-scaler
kubectl describe scaledobject worker-scaler
```

**What this does:** Creates a KEDA ScaledObject that monitors an AWS SQS queue and scales the worker Deployment proportionally to queue depth. With `queueLength: 100` as the trigger threshold, KEDA calculates replicas as `ceil(queue_depth / 100)` -- 5,000 messages results in 50 replicas. KEDA also supports scale-to-zero, stopping all worker pods when the queue is empty to save costs.

### Step 7: Load Test to Trigger All Autoscalers

```bash
chmod +x scripts/load-test.sh
./scripts/load-test.sh

# Monitor scaling in a separate terminal
watch -n5 'echo "=== HPA ===" && kubectl get hpa && echo "=== Pods ===" && kubectl get pods -l app=myapp | wc -l && echo "=== Nodes ===" && kubectl get nodes | wc -l'
```

**What this does:** Generates sustained HTTP load using `hey` to push CPU utilization above the HPA threshold, triggering pod-level scale-up. As new pods become unschedulable (no node capacity), Karpenter provisions additional nodes. The script also enqueues SQS messages to trigger KEDA scaling of the worker Deployment. This demonstrates all four autoscaling layers working together.

### Step 8: Analyze Scaling Behavior and Optimize Thresholds

```bash
# Review HPA scaling events
kubectl describe hpa myapp-hpa | grep -A20 "Events"

# Check VPA recommendations after load test
kubectl describe vpa myapp-vpa | grep -A10 "Recommendation"

# Review Karpenter provisioning decisions
kubectl logs -n karpenter -l app.kubernetes.io/name=karpenter --tail=50

# Check KEDA scaling events
kubectl describe scaledobject worker-scaler | grep -A10 "Events"
```

**What this does:** Reviews the scaling decisions made by each autoscaler during the load test. HPA events show replica count changes and the metric values that triggered them. VPA recommendations show whether current resource requests are appropriately sized. Karpenter logs reveal instance type selection and provisioning latency. This data informs threshold optimization for the next iteration.

## How I'd Explain This in an Interview

> "We were running 10 fixed replicas 24/7 -- wasting money at night and getting overwhelmed during peaks. I implemented multi-layer autoscaling with four components. HPA v2 scales the web pods based on CPU, memory, and a custom requests-per-second metric from Prometheus via the Prometheus Adapter. When HPA creates more pods than the cluster can fit, Karpenter provisions right-sized EC2 nodes in under 60 seconds -- much faster than Cluster Autoscaler's 3-5 minutes. For background workers, KEDA watches our SQS queue depth and scales workers proportionally, including scale-to-zero when the queue is empty. VPA runs in recommendation mode, analyzing actual usage to tell us our resource requests are over-provisioned by 40%. The result was a 50% cost reduction from elastic scaling and zero 503 errors during peak traffic."

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **HPA v2** -- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler version 2, supporting multiple metric types (Resource, Pods, Object) in a single autoscaler
- **Custom Metrics API** -- Kubernetes API extension that allows HPA to scale on application-specific metrics served by adapters like Prometheus Adapter
- **VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler)** -- Analyzes historical resource usage and recommends (or auto-applies) optimal CPU/memory requests and limits
- **Karpenter** -- AWS-native node autoscaler that provisions right-sized instances in seconds based on pending pod requirements
- **KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling)** -- Scales workloads based on external event sources (SQS, Kafka, Redis) including scale-to-zero capability
- **Stabilization Window** -- HPA configuration that prevents rapid scale-down flapping by requiring metrics to stay below threshold for a duration
- **Scale-to-Zero** -- KEDA capability to scale a Deployment to 0 replicas when no events are pending, eliminating idle compute costs
- **Bin Packing** -- Karpenter's consolidation feature that moves pods to fewer nodes to reduce waste from underutilized instances

## Lessons Learned

1. **HPA and VPA should not both manage the same resource** -- If HPA scales on CPU and VPA adjusts CPU requests, they can fight each other (VPA increases requests, HPA sees lower utilization and scales down). Use VPA in recommendation mode alongside HPA, or let VPA manage memory while HPA manages CPU.
2. **Custom metrics require the Prometheus Adapter** -- HPA v2 supports custom metrics in the spec, but the metrics must be served through the custom metrics API. Without the adapter bridge, HPA reports "unable to get metrics" and falls back to the last known replica count.
3. **Karpenter consolidation can be aggressive** -- Default consolidation settings may move pods between nodes frequently, causing connection drops. Set `consolidateAfter: 30s` and ensure PDBs are in place before enabling consolidation.
4. **KEDA scale-to-zero has a cold-start penalty** -- When KEDA scales from 0 to 1, the first message waits for a pod to start (~30 seconds for image pull + init). For latency-sensitive queues, set `minReplicaCount: 1` to keep a warm pod.
5. **Stabilization windows prevent flapping but delay scale-down** -- A 300-second scale-down stabilization window means 5 minutes of over-provisioning after load drops. Tune this based on your traffic patterns -- shorter for predictable load, longer for bursty traffic.
