## Summary

Built a Kubernetes Operator using the Operator SDK (Go) that manages the lifecycle of database instances through a custom resource called `MyDatabase`. The operator watches for `MyDatabase` resources and automatically provisions a Deployment, Service, and PersistentVolumeClaim, tracks state through a Status subresource, uses Finalizers for clean deletion, and validates input through a webhook. This lab demonstrates how the Operator pattern extends Kubernetes to manage domain-specific workflows with the same declarative model used for native resources.

## The Problem

The platform team manages database instances for application teams across multiple environments. The current provisioning process has significant pain points:

- **Manual provisioning** -- creating a database instance requires a DevOps engineer to manually write and apply a Deployment, Service, PVC, ConfigMap, and Secret (5 separate resources per database)
- **No lifecycle management** -- scaling, upgrading, and backing up databases requires ad-hoc scripts with no standardized process; each database is a snowflake
- **Inconsistent configuration** -- different teams configure databases differently (different resource limits, storage classes, backup schedules), leading to production incidents
- **Cleanup failures** -- deleting a database deployment often leaves orphaned PVCs and Secrets because engineers forget to clean up all associated resources
- **No custom validation** -- teams can create databases with invalid configurations (e.g., 50Mi storage for a production PostgreSQL instance) because kubectl cannot validate domain-specific business logic

## The Solution

Built a Kubernetes Operator that encapsulates database provisioning logic into a single custom resource:

- **CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)** -- defines a `MyDatabase` resource with fields like `engine`, `version`, `storageSize`, and `replicas`, giving teams a clean API
- **Reconciliation controller** -- watches `MyDatabase` resources and ensures the actual state (Deployment, Service, PVC) matches the desired state; self-heals on drift
- **Status subresource** -- reports the current state (`Provisioning`, `Running`, `Failed`) back on the resource, visible via `kubectl get mydatabases`
- **Finalizer** -- ensures that when a `MyDatabase` is deleted, all associated child resources (PVC, Secrets) are cleaned up before the CRD object is removed
- **Validating webhook** -- rejects invalid configurations at admission time (e.g., storage less than 1Gi, unsupported engine versions, replicas exceeding cluster capacity)

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose | Why I Chose It |
|---|---|---|
| Operator SDK 1.33 | Scaffolding and project structure | Official Red Hat tool for building operators; generates boilerplate, CRDs, RBAC, and webhook configs |
| Go 1.21 | Operator implementation language | First-class support in Operator SDK, strong typing catches errors at compile time, excellent Kubernetes client libraries |
| controller-runtime | Controller framework | Provides the reconcile loop, event watching, and caching primitives used by all kubebuilder-based operators |
| CustomResourceDefinitions | Kubernetes API extension | Native mechanism to define custom resources with schema validation, versioning, and kubectl integration |
| Admission Webhooks | Request validation | Intercepts API requests before persistence, enabling domain-specific validation that OpenAPI schemas cannot express |
| Kubernetes 1.28 | Cluster platform | Stable CRD v1 API, webhook conversion support, and status subresource for custom resources |

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Define CRD (MyDatabase custom resource)

```bash
# Apply the CRD to the cluster
kubectl apply -f config/crd/mydatabase-crd.yaml

# Verify CRD is registered
kubectl get crd mydatabases.database.example.com
kubectl api-resources | grep mydatabase

# View the CRD schema
kubectl explain mydatabase.spec
```

**What this does:** Registers the `MyDatabase` custom resource type with the Kubernetes API server. After this, the cluster understands `mydatabases.database.example.com` as a valid resource kind, with a defined OpenAPI v3 schema for spec fields like `engine`, `version`, `storageSize`, and `replicas`.

### Step 2: Initialize Operator project with Operator SDK

```bash
# Initialize a new operator project
mkdir -p mydatabase-operator && cd mydatabase-operator
operator-sdk init --domain example.com --repo github.com/example/mydatabase-operator

# Create the API (CRD types) and Controller
operator-sdk create api --group database --version v1alpha1 --kind MyDatabase --resource --controller

# View generated project structure
tree .
```

**What this does:** Scaffolds the complete operator project including Go module, Makefile, Dockerfile, RBAC manifests, and the controller/API boilerplate. The `create api` command generates the type definition (`mydatabase_types.go`) and reconciler stub (`mydatabase_controller.go`).

### Step 3: Implement Reconciler (create Deployment, Service, PVC)

```bash
# Build the operator binary
make build

# Run the operator locally (for development)
make run

# In another terminal, create a MyDatabase resource
kubectl apply -f config/samples/mydatabase-sample.yaml

# Observe the reconciler creating child resources
kubectl get deployments,services,pvc -l managed-by=mydatabase-operator
```

**What this does:** The reconciler watches for `MyDatabase` events and executes the reconcile loop: (1) fetch the `MyDatabase` resource, (2) check if a Deployment exists and create/update it, (3) check if a Service exists and create/update it, (4) check if a PVC exists and create/update it, (5) update the Status subresource. If any child resource drifts from desired state, the reconciler corrects it.

### Step 4: Add Status subresource for reporting state

```bash
# After operator processes the MyDatabase resource, check status
kubectl get mydatabases
kubectl get mydatabase my-postgres -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}'

# Watch status transitions
kubectl get mydatabase my-postgres -w

# View detailed status
kubectl describe mydatabase my-postgres
```

**What this does:** The Status subresource tracks the lifecycle phase (`Provisioning` -> `Running` -> `Failed`), the number of ready replicas, storage provisioning status, and conditions (similar to Pod conditions). Users see this in `kubectl get` output via the `additionalPrinterColumns` CRD feature.

### Step 5: Add Finalizer for cleanup on deletion

```bash
# Delete a MyDatabase resource
kubectl delete mydatabase my-postgres

# Observe the finalizer in action (resource enters Terminating state)
kubectl get mydatabase my-postgres -o jsonpath='{.metadata.finalizers}'

# Verify all child resources were cleaned up
kubectl get deployments,services,pvc -l managed-by=mydatabase-operator
# Expected: No resources found
```

**What this does:** When a `MyDatabase` resource is deleted, the Kubernetes API server sees the finalizer and sets `deletionTimestamp` instead of immediately removing the object. The controller detects this, deletes the PVC, Secret, Service, and Deployment, then removes the finalizer. Only then does Kubernetes actually delete the `MyDatabase` object from etcd.

### Step 6: Create validating webhook

```bash
# Deploy the webhook configuration
kubectl apply -f config/webhook/validating-webhook.yaml

# Test: try to create a database with invalid storage (too small)
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: database.example.com/v1alpha1
kind: MyDatabase
metadata:
  name: invalid-db
spec:
  engine: postgres
  version: "15"
  storageSize: 50Mi
  replicas: 1
EOF
# Expected: Error - storageSize must be at least 1Gi

# Test: try to create with unsupported engine
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: database.example.com/v1alpha1
kind: MyDatabase
metadata:
  name: invalid-db
spec:
  engine: oracle
  version: "19"
  storageSize: 10Gi
  replicas: 1
EOF
# Expected: Error - supported engines are: postgres, mysql, redis
```

**What this does:** The validating webhook intercepts `CREATE` and `UPDATE` requests for `MyDatabase` resources before they reach etcd. It validates business logic that the OpenAPI schema cannot express: minimum storage sizes per engine, supported version combinations, replica count limits, and naming conventions.

### Step 7: Deploy operator to cluster

```bash
# Build the operator container image
make docker-build IMG=mydatabase-operator:v0.1.0

# Load image into kind cluster (for local dev)
kind load docker-image mydatabase-operator:v0.1.0

# Deploy operator to cluster
make deploy IMG=mydatabase-operator:v0.1.0

# Verify operator pod is running
kubectl get pods -n mydatabase-operator-system
kubectl logs -n mydatabase-operator-system deploy/mydatabase-operator-controller-manager -f
```

**What this does:** Builds the operator as a container image, deploys it to the `mydatabase-operator-system` namespace with proper RBAC (ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding), and starts the controller manager which runs the reconcile loop continuously.

### Step 8: Create MyDatabase custom resources and observe reconciliation

```bash
# Create a PostgreSQL database
kubectl apply -f config/samples/mydatabase-sample.yaml

# Watch the operator create child resources
kubectl get events --watch --field-selector reason=SuccessfulCreate

# Verify all resources were created
kubectl get mydatabases
kubectl get deployments -l managed-by=mydatabase-operator
kubectl get services -l managed-by=mydatabase-operator
kubectl get pvc -l managed-by=mydatabase-operator

# Scale the database by editing the CR
kubectl patch mydatabase my-postgres --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"replicas":3}}'
kubectl get pods -l app=my-postgres -w
```

**What this does:** Creates a `MyDatabase` resource that triggers the full reconciliation cycle. The operator creates a Deployment (with the specified database image and version), a ClusterIP Service, and a PVC with the requested storage. Patching the CR triggers re-reconciliation, demonstrating that the operator continuously maintains desired state.

## How I'd Explain This in an Interview

> "Our platform team was spending 30-45 minutes manually provisioning each database instance by writing five separate Kubernetes manifests. Deletions frequently left orphaned PVCs, and teams regularly deployed invalid configurations. I built a Kubernetes Operator using the Operator SDK in Go that defines a custom resource called MyDatabase. When a user creates a MyDatabase resource specifying the engine, version, storage size, and replicas, the operator's reconciliation loop automatically creates the Deployment, Service, and PVC. I added a Status subresource so users can see the provisioning phase via kubectl. A Finalizer ensures that when a MyDatabase is deleted, all child resources -- including the PVC with persistent data -- are cleaned up. I also implemented a validating webhook that rejects invalid configurations at admission time, like storage below 1Gi or unsupported database engines. The operator follows the same declarative model as native Kubernetes resources: you declare desired state, and the controller reconciles actual state to match."

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Operator Pattern** -- encapsulates operational knowledge (how to deploy, scale, backup, and heal a database) into a controller that runs inside the cluster, replacing manual runbooks with automated reconciliation
- **CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)** -- extends the Kubernetes API with new resource types, enabling domain-specific abstractions (MyDatabase) that feel native to kubectl and the API server
- **Reconciliation Loop** -- the core control loop that compares desired state (CR spec) to actual state (child resources) and takes corrective action; the controller is re-triggered on any relevant change
- **Status Subresource** -- a separate API endpoint for updating resource status, preventing optimistic concurrency conflicts between spec updates (by users) and status updates (by the controller)
- **Finalizer** -- a string added to `metadata.finalizers` that prevents resource deletion until the controller has performed cleanup logic, ensuring no orphaned child resources
- **Validating Webhook** -- an admission webhook that intercepts API requests and rejects invalid resources before they are persisted to etcd, enforcing domain-specific business rules
- **Owner References** -- metadata linking child resources to their parent CR, enabling Kubernetes garbage collection to automatically delete children when the parent is deleted

## Lessons Learned

1. **Idempotency is non-negotiable** -- the reconcile function is called repeatedly (on events, periodic resyncs, errors). Every operation must be safe to run multiple times. Use `CreateOrUpdate` patterns instead of bare `Create` calls.
2. **Owner references handle most cleanup** -- before adding a Finalizer, I tried relying solely on Kubernetes garbage collection via owner references. It works for Deployments and Services but not for PVCs (which have different lifecycle requirements), hence the Finalizer.
3. **Status updates conflict with spec updates** -- initially updating status on the main resource caused `conflict` errors when users also edited spec. Moving to the Status subresource (`/status` endpoint) eliminated this because spec and status have independent resourceVersions.
4. **Webhook certificate management is painful** -- validating webhooks require TLS certificates that the API server trusts. cert-manager automates this, but setting it up correctly (especially the `caBundle` injection) took significant debugging.
5. **Start with `make run` before containerizing** -- running the operator locally during development provides fast feedback with direct log access. Only build the container image after the reconciliation logic is stable.
