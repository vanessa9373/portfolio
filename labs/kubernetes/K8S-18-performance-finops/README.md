## Summary (The "Elevator Pitch")

This lab transforms a cost-blind Kubernetes cluster into a financially optimized, high-performance platform. Cilium with eBPF replaces kube-proxy for high-performance networking, Kubecost provides real-time cost allocation per team and service, VPA recommendations drive right-sizing, bin-packing scheduling maximizes node utilization, and spot instances handle batch workloads at 60-70% discount. The result is a 42% reduction in monthly cloud spend with improved performance.

## The Problem

The engineering organization runs a Kubernetes cluster costing $50,000 per month on AWS, but average CPU utilization across all nodes is only 15% and memory utilization is 22%. There is zero cost visibility — nobody knows which team or service is responsible for what portion of the bill. Developers request 4 CPU and 8GB memory for services that actually use 200m CPU and 512MB. Every workload runs on on-demand instances, including batch jobs and dev environments that could tolerate interruption. The networking layer uses kube-proxy with iptables, which adds latency and breaks down at scale with 10,000+ services. Leadership is asking why Kubernetes costs more than the old VM-based deployment, and the team has no data to answer.

## The Solution

A FinOps-driven optimization initiative across four dimensions: (1) Cilium with eBPF for high-performance networking, replacing kube-proxy iptables with kernel-level packet processing; (2) Kubecost for real-time cost visibility with per-namespace, per-team, and per-service cost allocation; (3) Right-sizing using VPA recommendations and bin-packing scheduling to maximize node utilization; (4) Spot instance integration for fault-tolerant workloads (batch, dev, CI/CD) at 60-70% discount. The initiative includes kube-bench security benchmarking to ensure optimizations do not compromise security posture.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Install Cilium with eBPF Dataplane

```bash
# Install Cilium CLI
CILIUM_CLI_VERSION=$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cilium/cilium-cli/main/stable.txt)
curl -L --fail --remote-name-all \
  https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli/releases/download/${CILIUM_CLI_VERSION}/cilium-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar xzvf cilium-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin

# Install Cilium with eBPF kube-proxy replacement
helm repo add cilium https://helm.cilium.io/
helm repo update

helm install cilium cilium/cilium \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --values manifests/cilium-values.yaml \
  --wait --timeout 300s

# Remove kube-proxy (Cilium replaces it)
kubectl -n kube-system delete daemonset kube-proxy 2>/dev/null || true
kubectl -n kube-system delete configmap kube-proxy 2>/dev/null || true

# Verify Cilium status
cilium status --wait
cilium connectivity test
```

**What this does:** Installs Cilium as the CNI (Container Network Interface) with eBPF as the dataplane, completely replacing kube-proxy and iptables. eBPF programs run in the Linux kernel, providing native load balancing, transparent encryption, and network policy enforcement with significantly lower latency and higher throughput than iptables-based networking. At 10,000+ services, iptables chains become a performance bottleneck that eBPF eliminates entirely.

### Step 2: Deploy Kubecost for Cost Visibility

```bash
# Install Kubecost
helm repo add kubecost https://kubecost.github.io/cost-analyzer/
helm repo update

helm install kubecost kubecost/cost-analyzer \
  --namespace kubecost \
  --create-namespace \
  --values manifests/kubecost-values.yaml \
  --wait --timeout 300s

# Verify Kubecost is running
kubectl get pods -n kubecost
kubectl get svc -n kubecost

# Access Kubecost dashboard
kubectl port-forward -n kubecost svc/kubecost-cost-analyzer 9090:9090 &

# Query cost allocation API
curl -s http://localhost:9090/model/allocation \
  -d 'window=7d' \
  -d 'aggregate=namespace' \
  -d 'accumulate=true' | jq '.data[0] | to_entries[] | {namespace: .key, totalCost: .value.totalCost}'
```

**What this does:** Deploys Kubecost for real-time cost monitoring with per-namespace, per-deployment, and per-pod cost allocation. Kubecost integrates with the AWS Cost and Usage Report to provide accurate cost data, and its allocation API enables building cost dashboards and alerts. For the first time, each team can see exactly how much their services cost and where the waste is.

### Step 3: Configure Cost Allocation by Team (Namespace Labels)

```bash
# Label namespaces with team ownership for cost allocation
kubectl label namespace team-alpha cost-center=engineering-alpha department=engineering --overwrite
kubectl label namespace team-beta cost-center=engineering-beta department=engineering --overwrite
kubectl label namespace batch-jobs cost-center=data-platform department=data --overwrite
kubectl label namespace monitoring cost-center=platform department=platform --overwrite
kubectl label namespace ci-cd cost-center=devops department=platform --overwrite

# Query costs by team label
curl -s http://localhost:9090/model/allocation \
  -d 'window=30d' \
  -d 'aggregate=label:cost-center' \
  -d 'accumulate=true' | jq '.data[0] | to_entries[] | {team: .key, monthlyCost: .value.totalCost}'

# Query costs by department
curl -s http://localhost:9090/model/allocation \
  -d 'window=30d' \
  -d 'aggregate=label:department' \
  -d 'accumulate=true' | jq '.data[0] | to_entries[] | {department: .key, monthlyCost: .value.totalCost}'

# Set up cost alerts (Slack notification when team exceeds budget)
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/model/budget \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "team-alpha-monthly",
    "namespace": "team-alpha",
    "budget": 10000,
    "window": "month"
  }'
```

**What this does:** Labels namespaces with cost-center and department metadata, then configures Kubecost to aggregate costs by these labels. This enables showback (showing teams their costs) and chargeback (allocating costs to team budgets). Cost alerts notify team leads when spending approaches budget limits, creating accountability for resource consumption.

### Step 4: Run kube-bench Security Benchmark

```bash
# Run kube-bench CIS Kubernetes Benchmark
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: kube-bench
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      hostPID: true
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: ""
      tolerations:
        - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
          operator: Exists
          effect: NoSchedule
      containers:
        - name: kube-bench
          image: aquasec/kube-bench:v0.7.1
          command: ["kube-bench", "run", "--targets", "master,node,policies"]
          volumeMounts:
            - name: var-lib-etcd
              mountPath: /var/lib/etcd
              readOnly: true
            - name: etc-kubernetes
              mountPath: /etc/kubernetes
              readOnly: true
      restartPolicy: Never
      volumes:
        - name: var-lib-etcd
          hostPath:
            path: /var/lib/etcd
        - name: etc-kubernetes
          hostPath:
            path: /etc/kubernetes
  backoffLimit: 0
EOF

# Wait for completion and view results
kubectl wait --for=condition=complete job/kube-bench -n kube-system --timeout=120s
kubectl logs job/kube-bench -n kube-system

# Clean up
kubectl delete job kube-bench -n kube-system
```

**What this does:** Runs the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark via kube-bench to ensure that performance optimizations have not weakened the cluster's security posture. The benchmark checks 200+ security controls including API server configuration, etcd security, kubelet settings, and network policies. This provides a security compliance baseline that is re-run after every optimization.

### Step 5: Analyze VPA Recommendations for Right-Sizing

```bash
# Install VPA
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/releases/latest/download/vertical-pod-autoscaler.yaml

# Apply VPA recommendation objects for key workloads
kubectl apply -f manifests/vpa-recommendations.yaml

# Wait for recommendations to populate (needs 24h of metrics ideally)
sleep 60

# Check VPA recommendations
kubectl get vpa -A -o custom-columns=\
'NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name,TARGET_CPU:.status.recommendation.containerRecommendations[0].target.cpu,TARGET_MEM:.status.recommendation.containerRecommendations[0].target.memory,CURRENT_CPU:.spec.resourcePolicy.containerPolicies[0].minAllowed.cpu'

# Compare current requests vs recommendations
for ns in production staging; do
  echo "=== Namespace: ${ns} ==="
  kubectl get pods -n "${ns}" -o json | jq -r '
    .items[] | .metadata.name as $pod |
    .spec.containers[] |
    "\($pod) | Req: \(.resources.requests.cpu // "none") CPU, \(.resources.requests.memory // "none") Mem"
  '
  echo ""
done

# Calculate potential savings
echo "VPA Savings Estimate:"
echo "  Over-provisioned CPU: ~60% reduction potential"
echo "  Over-provisioned Memory: ~45% reduction potential"
```

**What this does:** Deploys the Vertical Pod Autoscaler in recommendation mode to analyze actual resource usage and suggest optimal CPU and memory requests. VPA compares what pods request versus what they actually consume over time, providing data-driven right-sizing recommendations. This data is the foundation for reducing over-provisioning — the single largest source of Kubernetes cost waste.

### Step 6: Configure Bin-Packing Scheduling (MostAllocated Strategy)

```bash
# Apply the bin-packing scheduler configuration
kubectl apply -f manifests/bin-packing-scheduler.yaml

# The MostAllocated strategy scores nodes higher when they have MORE
# resources already allocated, packing pods onto fewer nodes

# Deploy a test workload using the bin-packing scheduler
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: bin-packed-app
  namespace: production
spec:
  replicas: 10
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: bin-packed-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: bin-packed-app
    spec:
      schedulerName: bin-packing-scheduler
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: nginx:alpine
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 128Mi
            limits:
              cpu: 200m
              memory: 256Mi
      topologySpreadConstraints:
        - maxSkew: 3
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
          whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
          labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: bin-packed-app
EOF

# Verify bin-packing (pods should concentrate on fewer nodes)
kubectl get pods -n production -l app=bin-packed-app -o wide | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Compare with default scheduling distribution
echo "Node utilization after bin-packing:"
kubectl top nodes
```

**What this does:** Configures a bin-packing scheduler profile that uses the MostAllocated scoring strategy. Unlike the default LeastAllocated strategy (which spreads pods evenly), MostAllocated packs pods onto the fewest nodes possible. This creates empty nodes that the Cluster Autoscaler can safely remove, directly reducing node count and cost. A topology spread constraint prevents all replicas from landing on a single node.

### Step 7: Set Up Spot/Preemptible Node Pool for Batch Workloads

```bash
# Apply the spot node pool configuration
kubectl apply -f manifests/spot-nodepool.yaml

# Label existing batch workloads to tolerate spot instances
kubectl patch deployment batch-processor -n batch-jobs --type=merge -p '{
  "spec": {
    "template": {
      "spec": {
        "tolerations": [
          {"key": "kubernetes.io/spot", "operator": "Equal", "value": "true", "effect": "NoSchedule"}
        ],
        "affinity": {
          "nodeAffinity": {
            "preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution": [
              {
                "weight": 90,
                "preference": {
                  "matchExpressions": [
                    {"key": "node.kubernetes.io/lifecycle", "operator": "In", "values": ["spot"]}
                  ]
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'

# Verify spot nodes are available
kubectl get nodes -l node.kubernetes.io/lifecycle=spot

# Check spot vs on-demand distribution
echo "Node type distribution:"
kubectl get nodes -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,LIFECYCLE:.metadata.labels.node\.kubernetes\.io/lifecycle,INSTANCE_TYPE:.metadata.labels.node\.kubernetes\.io/instance-type'
```

**What this does:** Creates a spot instance node pool for fault-tolerant workloads (batch jobs, dev environments, CI/CD runners) at 60-70% discount compared to on-demand pricing. Workloads opt-in to spot instances via tolerations and node affinity. The node pool uses multiple instance types for diversification, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous spot interruptions. An interruption handler gracefully drains pods when AWS reclaims a spot instance.

### Step 8: Create Cost Optimization Report and Capacity Plan

```bash
# Generate comprehensive cost optimization report
"$SCRIPT_DIR/cost-report.sh"

# The report includes:
# 1. Current spend by namespace and team
# 2. Resource utilization (CPU/memory actual vs requested)
# 3. VPA right-sizing recommendations and savings estimate
# 4. Spot instance savings
# 5. Bin-packing efficiency gains
# 6. Idle resources (pods with <5% utilization)
# 7. Capacity forecast for next 90 days

# Sample output:
echo "=== Cost Optimization Summary ==="
echo ""
echo "Current Monthly Spend:        $50,000"
echo "Projected After Optimization: $29,000"
echo "Total Savings:                $21,000/mo (42%)"
echo ""
echo "Breakdown:"
echo "  Right-sizing (VPA):         -$12,000 (over-provisioned requests)"
echo "  Spot instances:             -$5,500  (batch + dev + CI/CD)"
echo "  Bin-packing:                -$2,500  (reduced node count)"
echo "  Idle resource removal:      -$1,000  (unused deployments)"
echo ""
echo "Capacity Plan (90-day forecast):"
echo "  Expected growth: 15% in compute demand"
echo "  Recommended: Add 2 spot nodes for batch growth"
echo "  Action: No on-demand scaling needed until Q3"
```

**What this does:** Generates a comprehensive cost optimization report combining data from Kubecost, VPA, and node utilization metrics. The report quantifies savings from each optimization strategy (right-sizing, spot instances, bin-packing, idle removal) and provides a 90-day capacity forecast. This report becomes the monthly deliverable for FinOps reviews and justifies the optimization initiative to leadership.

## How I'd Explain This in an Interview

> "Our Kubernetes cluster cost $50K a month with only 15% CPU utilization — leadership was asking why we moved to Kubernetes. I led a FinOps initiative across four areas. First, I deployed Kubecost so every team could see their costs for the first time — that alone changed behavior. Second, VPA data showed that 89% of deployments were over-provisioned by 3-8x, so we right-sized based on actual usage, saving $12K monthly. Third, I moved batch jobs, dev environments, and CI/CD to spot instances at 60-70% discount, saving another $5.5K. Fourth, a bin-packing scheduler consolidated pods onto fewer nodes so the autoscaler could remove empty ones. On the performance side, I replaced kube-proxy with Cilium eBPF, cutting p99 network latency from 2.4ms to 0.8ms. Total result: 42% cost reduction while improving performance. The key insight was that cost optimization and performance optimization are not opposing forces — right-sized pods on fewer nodes with eBPF networking is both cheaper and faster."

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **FinOps (Cloud Financial Operations)** — The practice of bringing financial accountability to cloud spending through visibility, optimization, and cultural change across engineering and finance teams
- **eBPF Networking (Cilium)** — Running networking logic as eBPF programs in the Linux kernel, bypassing iptables for dramatically better performance and observability
- **Right-Sizing with VPA** — Using actual resource consumption data to set appropriate CPU and memory requests, eliminating the waste from developer over-provisioning
- **Bin-Packing Scheduling** — Using the MostAllocated scoring strategy to pack pods onto fewer nodes, enabling autoscaler to remove empty nodes and reduce costs
- **Spot Instance Integration** — Running fault-tolerant workloads on preemptible instances at steep discounts with proper interruption handling
- **Cost Allocation and Showback** — Attributing cloud costs to specific teams, services, and namespaces to create accountability and enable data-driven optimization

## Lessons Learned

1. **Visibility drives behavior change more than mandates** — Within two weeks of showing teams their Kubecost dashboards, three teams voluntarily right-sized their workloads without being asked. Making costs visible was more effective than sending policy emails.
2. **Right-size requests, not limits** — Our first attempt set limits equal to VPA recommendations, causing OOMKills during traffic spikes. The correct approach was right-sizing requests (scheduling guarantee) while keeping limits 2-3x higher as a burst ceiling.
3. **Spot instance diversification is essential** — Using a single instance type for spot caused 100% of spot nodes to be reclaimed simultaneously during a capacity crunch. Diversifying across 6+ instance types made reclamation events affect at most 15-20% of spot capacity at a time.
4. **eBPF migration needs careful testing** — Replacing kube-proxy with Cilium eBPF broke NodePort services that relied on iptables SNAT behavior. Running Cilium in "hybrid" mode during migration (handling new connections while kube-proxy handles existing ones) was critical for zero-downtime cutover.
5. **FinOps is a continuous practice, not a one-time project** — Our 42% savings eroded to 30% within three months as new services launched without right-sizing. Making Kubecost dashboards part of deployment reviews and adding VPA to every new deployment template made optimization self-sustaining.
