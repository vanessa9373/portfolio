## Summary (The "Elevator Pitch")

This lab tears open the Kubernetes control plane to understand, configure, and harden its core components. It covers etcd backup and restore procedures, API server audit logging and rate limiting, custom scheduler profiles, admission controller configuration, and safe kubeadm cluster upgrades. Every production cluster depends on these internals, and most engineers treat them as a black box until something breaks.

## The Problem

The operations team manages 8 Kubernetes clusters but treats the control plane as a black box. etcd has never been backed up — a single corruption event would mean total data loss and rebuilding every cluster from scratch. The API server runs with default configuration: no audit logging (compliance violation), no rate limiting (one runaway controller could DoS the API), and default admission controllers. Cluster upgrades are feared because the last attempt caused 45 minutes of downtime when the team skipped the proper version sequence. There is no visibility into what requests hit the API server or who is making them.

## The Solution

A comprehensive control plane hardening initiative: automated etcd snapshots with tested restore procedures, API server audit logging piped to a centralized log system, API Priority and Fairness for request rate limiting, a custom scheduler profile for specialized workloads, safe kubeadm upgrade procedures documented and tested, and additional admission controllers to enforce policies. The goal is moving from "hope nothing breaks" to "we know exactly what is happening and can recover from anything."

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Explore Control Plane Components

```bash
# List all control plane pods
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l tier=control-plane

# Examine the kube-apiserver configuration
kubectl get pod kube-apiserver-control-plane -n kube-system -o yaml | \
  grep -A 50 "containers:" | grep -E "^\s+- --"

# Check etcd health
kubectl exec -n kube-system etcd-control-plane -- etcdctl \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  endpoint health

# View current etcd database size
kubectl exec -n kube-system etcd-control-plane -- etcdctl \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  endpoint status --write-out=table
```

**What this does:** Inspects the running control plane components to understand the current configuration. This establishes a baseline before making changes and verifies that etcd is healthy. Understanding the flags passed to kube-apiserver is essential for knowing what features are enabled.

### Step 2: Configure etcd Backup (Snapshot + CronJob)

```bash
# Apply the etcd backup CronJob
kubectl apply -f manifests/etcd-backup-cronjob.yaml

# Run an immediate manual backup to test
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/etcd-backup etcd-backup-manual -n kube-system

# Watch the backup job complete
kubectl wait --for=condition=complete job/etcd-backup-manual \
  -n kube-system --timeout=120s

# Verify the snapshot was created
kubectl logs job/etcd-backup-manual -n kube-system

# Manual snapshot command (for reference)
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save /backup/etcd-snapshot.db \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key

# Verify snapshot integrity
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot status /backup/etcd-snapshot.db --write-out=table
```

**What this does:** Creates an automated CronJob that takes etcd snapshots every 6 hours and stores them on a persistent volume. Also demonstrates the manual snapshot process which is essential knowledge for the CKA exam. The snapshot captures the entire cluster state: all resources, secrets, configmaps, and RBAC policies.

### Step 3: Test etcd Restore from Snapshot

```bash
# This procedure restores etcd from a snapshot
# WARNING: Only run this in a test environment

# Stop the API server (move the static pod manifest)
sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml /tmp/

# Stop etcd
sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml /tmp/

# Restore from snapshot
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore /backup/etcd-snapshot.db \
  --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd-restored \
  --name=control-plane \
  --initial-cluster=control-plane=https://127.0.0.1:2380 \
  --initial-advertise-peer-urls=https://127.0.0.1:2380

# Update etcd manifest to use restored data directory
sudo sed -i 's|/var/lib/etcd|/var/lib/etcd-restored|g' /tmp/etcd.yaml

# Restart etcd and API server
sudo mv /tmp/etcd.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
sudo mv /tmp/kube-apiserver.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/

# Wait for control plane to recover
sleep 30
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

**What this does:** Demonstrates a full etcd disaster recovery procedure. This is the most critical operation a cluster administrator can perform — restoring the entire cluster state from a backup. The process involves stopping the control plane, restoring the etcd data directory from a snapshot, and restarting all components.

### Step 4: Enable API Server Audit Logging

```bash
# Apply the audit policy
sudo cp manifests/audit-policy.yaml /etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml

# Add audit flags to kube-apiserver static pod
# Edit /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml to add:
#   --audit-policy-file=/etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml
#   --audit-log-path=/var/log/kubernetes/audit.log
#   --audit-log-maxage=30
#   --audit-log-maxbackup=10
#   --audit-log-maxsize=100

# Verify the API server restarts with audit logging
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l component=kube-apiserver -w

# Test audit logging by performing an action
kubectl create namespace audit-test
kubectl delete namespace audit-test

# Check audit logs
sudo tail -20 /var/log/kubernetes/audit.log | jq '.verb, .objectRef.resource'
```

**What this does:** Enables API server audit logging with a tiered policy that captures different detail levels for different resources. Secrets are logged at the Metadata level (no values), while other resources get RequestResponse level. This provides the forensic trail needed for security compliance and debugging.

### Step 5: Configure API Priority and Fairness

```bash
# Apply API Priority and Fairness configuration
kubectl apply -f manifests/api-priority-fairness.yaml

# Check existing flow schemas
kubectl get flowschemas
kubectl get prioritylevelconfigurations

# Monitor API server request handling
kubectl get --raw /debug/api_priority_and_fairness/dump_priority_levels

# Test: verify rate limiting under load
kubectl run load-test --image=bitnami/kubectl --restart=Never -- \
  sh -c 'for i in $(seq 1 1000); do kubectl get pods -A > /dev/null 2>&1; done'

# Check APF metrics
kubectl get --raw /metrics | grep apiserver_flowcontrol
```

**What this does:** Configures API Priority and Fairness to protect the API server from being overwhelmed by any single client. Operator workloads get a guaranteed share of API bandwidth, while monitoring tools are given lower priority. This prevents a misbehaving controller from causing API server brownouts that affect the entire cluster.

### Step 6: Create Custom Scheduler Profile

```bash
# Apply the custom scheduler configuration
sudo cp manifests/scheduler-config.yaml /etc/kubernetes/scheduler-config.yaml

# Update kube-scheduler to use the new config
# Edit /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml to add:
#   --config=/etc/kubernetes/scheduler-config.yaml

# Verify the scheduler restarts
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l component=kube-scheduler -w

# Test: deploy a pod that uses the custom scheduler profile
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: high-priority-pod
spec:
  schedulerName: high-priority-scheduler
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx:alpine
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 128Mi
EOF

# Verify the pod was scheduled by the custom profile
kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.name=high-priority-pod
```

**What this does:** Creates a custom scheduler profile that uses different scoring plugins for high-priority workloads. The custom profile prioritizes nodes with the most available resources (spreading) rather than the default behavior, which is useful for latency-sensitive workloads that need dedicated resources.

### Step 7: Enable Additional Admission Controllers

```bash
# View currently enabled admission controllers
kubectl exec -n kube-system kube-apiserver-control-plane -- \
  kube-apiserver --help 2>&1 | grep enable-admission-plugins

# Key admission controllers to enable:
# - PodSecurity (replaces PodSecurityPolicy)
# - ResourceQuota
# - LimitRanger
# - NodeRestriction
# - AlwaysPullImages

# Modify the kube-apiserver manifest:
# --enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,PodSecurity,ResourceQuota,LimitRanger,AlwaysPullImages

# Wait for API server to restart
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l component=kube-apiserver -w

# Verify AlwaysPullImages is working
kubectl run test-always-pull --image=nginx:alpine --restart=Never
kubectl get pod test-always-pull -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].imagePullPolicy}'
# Should output: Always
```

**What this does:** Enables additional admission controllers that enforce security and resource policies. AlwaysPullImages prevents using cached images (prevents container escape attacks), NodeRestriction limits what kubelets can modify, and PodSecurity enforces pod security standards at the namespace level.

### Step 8: Perform kubeadm Cluster Upgrade

```bash
# Check current version
kubectl version --short
kubeadm version

# Check available upgrade versions
sudo kubeadm upgrade plan

# Upgrade the control plane (one minor version at a time)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.29.0-1.1
sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.29.0 --yes

# Upgrade kubelet and kubectl on control plane
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=1.29.0-1.1 kubectl=1.29.0-1.1
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart kubelet

# Upgrade worker nodes (one at a time)
# On each worker:
kubectl drain worker-1 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
# SSH to worker:
#   sudo apt-get update
#   sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.29.0-1.1 kubelet=1.29.0-1.1
#   sudo kubeadm upgrade node
#   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
#   sudo systemctl restart kubelet
kubectl uncordon worker-1

# Verify upgrade
kubectl get nodes
kubectl version
```

**What this does:** Performs a safe, rolling kubeadm cluster upgrade one minor version at a time. The control plane is upgraded first, then each worker node is drained (workloads rescheduled), upgraded, and uncordoned. This procedure ensures zero downtime for applications while keeping the cluster on a supported Kubernetes version.

## How I'd Explain This in an Interview

> "Our team managed 8 clusters but treated the control plane as a black box. etcd had zero backups — one corruption would mean rebuilding from scratch. I implemented automated etcd snapshots every 6 hours with a tested restore procedure that gets us back in 15 minutes. I enabled API server audit logging for compliance and configured API Priority and Fairness after we had repeated brownouts from a misbehaving operator flooding the API. For upgrades, I documented and automated the kubeadm process — our last manual attempt caused 45 minutes of downtime because we skipped a version. Now we do rolling upgrades with zero downtime. The key lesson was that understanding control plane internals is not optional for production — it is the difference between a 15-minute recovery and a multi-day outage."

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **etcd Backup and Restore** — Taking consistent snapshots of the cluster state store and restoring from them, which is the foundation of Kubernetes disaster recovery
- **API Server Audit Logging** — Recording all API requests at configurable detail levels for security compliance, forensics, and operational debugging
- **API Priority and Fairness** — Kubernetes-native rate limiting that ensures fair API server bandwidth allocation across different clients and workloads
- **Admission Controllers** — Plugins that intercept API requests after authentication/authorization to enforce policies before objects are persisted to etcd
- **kubeadm Upgrades** — Safe, rolling cluster upgrades that respect the Kubernetes version skew policy and maintain workload availability
- **Custom Scheduler Profiles** — Extending the default scheduler with custom scoring and filtering plugins for specialized workload placement needs

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test your restores, not just your backups** — We had etcd snapshots for weeks before discovering our restore procedure had a bug in the initial cluster configuration. The first time you test a restore should not be during an actual outage.
2. **Audit log volume is larger than you expect** — Our first audit policy logged everything at RequestResponse level and generated 2GB per day. Moving to a tiered policy (Metadata for secrets, RequestResponse only for writes) reduced volume by 80%.
3. **API Priority and Fairness needs tuning** — The default APF configuration is conservative. We had to create custom FlowSchemas after our ArgoCD controller was being throttled by the default "global-default" priority level during large deployments.
4. **Never skip Kubernetes minor versions** — The version skew policy exists for a reason. Our 45-minute outage happened because we tried jumping from 1.26 to 1.28. Always upgrade one minor version at a time, even if it means multiple upgrade cycles.
5. **Static pod manifests are the control plane's single point of truth** — Understanding that /etc/kubernetes/manifests is where the kubelet reads control plane pod definitions unlocked my ability to configure every aspect of the control plane. Backing up these manifests before any change became second nature.
