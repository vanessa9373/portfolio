## Summary (The "Elevator Pitch")

Production-grade CI/CD system combining GitHub Actions with ArgoCD GitOps and Argo Rollouts for progressive delivery. Implements canary deployments that gradually shift traffic (10% → 30% → 100%) with automated analysis — if error rates spike, the deployment automatically rolls back without human intervention.

## The Problem

Standard Kubernetes rolling updates deploy new code to all pods simultaneously. If the new version has a bug, **all users are affected** before anyone notices. Rollbacks take minutes during which the broken version serves traffic. There's no way to test with real production traffic before going fully live.

## The Solution

Implemented **canary deployments** using Argo Rollouts — new versions first receive 10% of traffic, then 30%, then 100%. At each step, automated analysis checks error rates and latency from Prometheus. If metrics degrade, the rollout automatically aborts and reverts to the stable version. This catches production bugs with minimal user impact.

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose | Why I Chose It |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| Argo Rollouts | Progressive delivery (canary/blue-green) | Automated analysis + rollback |
| ArgoCD | GitOps deployment | Declarative, auto-sync |
| GitHub Actions | CI pipeline | Test, build, scan, push |
| Helm | Kubernetes templating | Multi-env values, release management |
| Prometheus | Metrics for canary analysis | ArgoCD queries it for success criteria |

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Install ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts
**What this does:** Deploys ArgoCD for GitOps sync and Argo Rollouts controller for canary/blue-green deployments.
```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f argocd/install.yaml
kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/install.yaml
```

### Step 2: Deploy with Helm
**What this does:** Deploys the application using Helm charts with environment-specific values.
```bash
helm install myapp helm/ -f helm/values.yaml           # Default
helm install myapp helm/ -f helm/values-staging.yaml    # Staging
helm install myapp helm/ -f helm/values-production.yaml # Production
```

### Step 3: Configure Canary Rollout
**What this does:** Defines the canary strategy — traffic percentages, analysis duration, and success criteria.
```bash
kubectl apply -f argocd/rollout.yaml
```

### Step 4: Trigger a Canary Deployment
**What this does:** Push a code change, CI builds new image, ArgoCD syncs, Argo Rollouts starts canary progression.
```bash
git push origin main
# Monitor canary progress:
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout myapp --watch
```

### Step 5: Manual Promotion or Rollback
**What this does:** Manually promote a paused canary or abort if testing reveals issues.
```bash
kubectl argo rollouts promote myapp       # Promote to 100%
kubectl argo rollouts abort myapp         # Abort and rollback
./scripts/rollback.sh                     # Full rollback script
```

## Key Files Explained

| File | What It Does | Key Concepts |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `argocd/rollout.yaml` | Defines canary steps: 10% → pause → 30% → pause → 100% with Prometheus analysis | Canary deployment, traffic splitting |
| `helm/values-production.yaml` | Production-specific config: replicas, resources, canary thresholds | Environment separation, Helm values |
| `helm/templates/pdb.yaml` | Pod Disruption Budget — ensures minimum available pods during updates | High availability during deploys |
| `github-actions/ci-pipeline.yaml` | Full CI: lint, unit tests, Docker build, Trivy scan, ECR push | Pipeline stages, security scanning |
| `scripts/rollback.sh` | Automated rollback: abort rollout, verify pods, notify Slack | Incident response, automation |

## Results & Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Blast Radius (Bad Deploy) | 100% of users | 10% max | **90% reduction** |
| Rollback Time | 15-30 minutes | Automatic (< 1 min) | **99% faster** |
| Failed Deploys Reaching Prod | Frequent | Near zero (caught in canary) | **Automated detection** |
| Deployment Confidence | Low (manual process) | High (automated analysis) | **Data-driven deploys** |

## How I'd Explain This in an Interview

> "Standard Kubernetes rolling updates are all-or-nothing — if the new version has a bug, all users are affected. I implemented canary deployments with Argo Rollouts where new code first gets 10% of traffic, then 30%, then 100%. At each step, the system queries Prometheus to check error rates and latency. If error rates exceed 1%, the deployment automatically rolls back without any human intervention. This reduced the blast radius of bad deployments from 100% to 10% of users and made rollbacks automatic instead of a 30-minute scramble."

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Progressive Delivery** — Canary deployments with traffic splitting
- **Automated Analysis** — Prometheus-backed success criteria
- **Auto-Rollback** — Automatic revert when metrics degrade
- **Helm Charts** — Multi-environment templated deployments
- **Pod Disruption Budget** — Maintains availability during updates
- **GitOps** — ArgoCD auto-sync from Git to cluster

## Lessons Learned

1. **Canary analysis needs good metrics** — if your app doesn't expose error rate metrics, canary analysis can't work
2. **Pod Disruption Budgets prevent outages** — without PDB, a rollout can take down too many pods at once
3. **Start with manual promotion** — gain confidence before enabling full auto-promotion
4. **Helm values per environment** — separate staging and production configurations cleanly
5. **Rollback scripts should notify** — automated rollback should alert the team via Slack
