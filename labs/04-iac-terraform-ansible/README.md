## Summary (The "Elevator Pitch")

Built a production-ready IaC framework using Terraform for cloud provisioning and Ansible for server configuration. Covers the full lifecycle — from creating AWS infrastructure (VPC, EC2, EKS, ALB) to configuring servers (Docker, security hardening, monitoring agents) and deploying applications with zero-downtime rolling updates across dev, staging, and production.

## The Problem

Infrastructure was provisioned manually through the AWS console — clicking through wizards, which was slow, error-prone, and impossible to replicate consistently. Server configuration was done via SSH and ad-hoc scripts, meaning every server was slightly different ("snowflake servers"). Promoting from dev to staging to production was a manual, risky process.

## The Solution

Split infrastructure automation into two layers: **Terraform** handles "what infrastructure exists" (VPC, EC2, EKS, ALB, RDS) and **Ansible** handles "how servers are configured" (install Docker, harden SSH, deploy monitoring agents, deploy applications). Multi-environment promotion (dev → staging → prod) uses the same code with different variable files.

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose | Why I Chose It |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| Terraform | Cloud resource provisioning | Declarative, state tracking, plan before apply |
| Ansible | Server configuration management | Agentless (SSH-based), idempotent, YAML playbooks |
| AWS EC2 | Compute instances | Full control over server configuration |
| AWS EKS | Kubernetes orchestration | Managed control plane, integrates with IAM |
| AWS ALB | Load balancing | Health checks, target group routing |
| Docker | Application containerization | Consistent runtime environment |

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Provision Infrastructure with Terraform
**What this does:** Creates the full AWS environment — VPC, subnets, EC2 instances, EKS cluster, ALB, RDS, and security groups.
```bash
cd terraform/environments/dev
terraform init && terraform apply
```

### Step 2: Generate Ansible Inventory
**What this does:** Terraform outputs EC2 instance IPs, which become Ansible's inventory (list of servers to configure).
```bash
terraform output -json > ../../ansible/inventory/terraform_outputs.json
cd ../../ansible
./scripts/generate-inventory.sh
```

### Step 3: Harden Servers with Ansible
**What this does:** Runs security hardening — disables root SSH, configures firewall rules, sets up fail2ban, enables automatic security updates.
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbooks/security-hardening.yml
```

### Step 4: Install Docker and Monitoring
**What this does:** Installs Docker runtime, Prometheus node exporter, and CloudWatch agent on all servers.
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbooks/setup-docker.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbooks/setup-monitoring.yml
```

### Step 5: Deploy Application
**What this does:** Deploys the application with zero-downtime rolling updates — updates one server at a time, waits for health checks to pass before proceeding.
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbooks/deploy-app.yml --extra-vars "version=1.2.3"
```

### Step 6: Promote to Staging/Production
**What this does:** Uses the same Terraform and Ansible code with different variable files per environment.
```bash
cd terraform/environments/staging
terraform apply
cd ../../../ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory/staging playbooks/deploy-app.yml
```

## How I'd Explain This in an Interview

> "I built an end-to-end IaC framework splitting responsibilities between Terraform and Ansible. Terraform provisions the cloud infrastructure — VPC, EC2, EKS, databases — and Ansible configures what's on the servers — Docker, security hardening, monitoring agents, application deployment. The key insight is using Terraform's outputs as Ansible's inventory, so the two tools work as a pipeline. We promote from dev to staging to production using the same code with different variable files, ensuring environments are identical. Rolling deployments update one server at a time with health checks, giving us zero-downtime deploys."

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Terraform + Ansible Integration** — Terraform provisions, Ansible configures
- **Multi-Environment Promotion** — Same code, different variables (dev → staging → prod)
- **Server Hardening** — CIS benchmark compliance via Ansible roles
- **Rolling Deployments** — Zero-downtime updates with health check gates
- **Idempotent Configuration** — Run Ansible multiple times, get the same result
- **Infrastructure Modules** — Reusable Terraform modules across environments

## Lessons Learned

1. **Terraform for infrastructure, Ansible for configuration** — don't try to do everything with one tool
2. **Auto-generate Ansible inventory from Terraform** — manual inventory files go stale immediately
3. **Test in dev first** — Terraform `plan` catches infrastructure issues; Ansible `--check` catches config issues
4. **Rolling deploys need health checks** — without them, you'll deploy broken code to all servers
5. **Keep environments identical** — any drift between dev and prod will cause production surprises
