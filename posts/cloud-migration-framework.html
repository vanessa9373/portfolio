        <p>Cloud migration is one of the most impactful — and most misunderstood — initiatives an organization can undertake. After leading migrations across AWS, Azure, and GCP for over a dozen client engagements, I've distilled my approach into a repeatable five-step framework that balances speed with safety.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Discovery & Assessment</h2>
        <p>Every successful migration starts with understanding what you actually have. I begin with a comprehensive inventory of existing infrastructure: servers, databases, networking topology, dependencies, and traffic patterns. Tools like <strong>AWS Application Discovery Service</strong> and <strong>Azure Migrate</strong> can automate much of this, but nothing replaces conversations with the teams who built and operate the systems.</p>
        <p>Key deliverables from this phase include a dependency map, a workload classification (by criticality and complexity), and a preliminary TCO comparison between current on-prem costs and projected cloud spend. I've found that organizations consistently underestimate their true on-prem costs by 30-40% when they forget to account for facilities, power, cooling, and staff overhead.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Strategy Selection (The 6 R's)</h2>
        <p>Not every workload should be migrated the same way. I use the 6 R's framework to categorize each application:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rehost</strong> (lift-and-shift) — move as-is for quick wins</li>
          <li><strong>Replatform</strong> — minor optimizations during migration (e.g., swap to RDS instead of self-managed MySQL)</li>
          <li><strong>Repurchase</strong> — replace with a SaaS solution</li>
          <li><strong>Refactor</strong> — re-architect for cloud-native (microservices, serverless)</li>
          <li><strong>Retire</strong> — decommission applications nobody uses</li>
          <li><strong>Retain</strong> — keep on-prem for now (compliance, latency requirements)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In practice, I've found that 60-70% of workloads in a typical enterprise can be rehosted or replatformed, delivering fast ROI while you plan deeper refactoring for the remaining high-value applications.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Landing Zone & Foundation</h2>
        <p>Before migrating a single workload, you need a solid foundation. This means building your landing zone: a well-architected multi-account structure with networking, security baselines, IAM policies, and logging already in place.</p>
        <p>I use <strong>Terraform modules</strong> to codify the landing zone so it's repeatable across environments and clients. A typical setup includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Organizational Units (OUs) for workload, security, and shared services accounts</li>
          <li>Hub-and-spoke VPC architecture with Transit Gateway</li>
          <li>Centralized logging (CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty) flowing to a security account</li>
          <li>Baseline IAM roles with least-privilege policies</li>
          <li>DNS and certificate management via Route 53 and ACM</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 4: Migration Execution</h2>
        <p>I migrate in waves, starting with low-risk, low-dependency workloads. Each wave follows the same pattern: provision infrastructure with Terraform, deploy the application, run parallel testing, perform the cutover during a maintenance window, then validate with synthetic monitoring.</p>
        <p>The most common pitfall I see is skipping the parallel-run phase. Running both environments simultaneously for 1-2 weeks catches data synchronization issues, latency differences, and integration bugs before they become production incidents. Yes, it costs more short-term, but it saves you from the 3 AM "everything is on fire" phone call.</p>

        <h2>Step 5: Optimization & Operations</h2>
        <p>Migration doesn't end at cutover. The first 90 days post-migration are critical for right-sizing instances, implementing Reserved Instances or Savings Plans, setting up auto-scaling policies, and tuning monitoring and alerting.</p>
        <p>I've consistently achieved <strong>20-35% additional cost savings</strong> in this phase by right-sizing over-provisioned instances and switching to graviton-based or spot instances where appropriate. I also establish a FinOps practice with monthly cost reviews, anomaly alerts, and tagging enforcement to prevent cloud spend from creeping back up.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Cloud migration is a journey, not a project. The organizations that succeed treat it as a continuous improvement cycle — migrating, optimizing, and iterating. This framework has helped me deliver migrations that reduce costs by 25-35%, improve uptime to 99.95%+, and set teams up for long-term cloud success.</p>
